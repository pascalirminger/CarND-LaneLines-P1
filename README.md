# Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree :: Finding Lane Lines on the Road

This repo contains the code written to complete the first project on [Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) (Term 1). This project aggregates algorithms to identify and mark lane lines on the road. The algorithms work for images and videos which are taken from a camera at the center of a vehicle.
